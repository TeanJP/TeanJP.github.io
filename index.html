                    Welcome to my portfolio page! I am a games programming graduate who has had a passion for video games, both playing and developing them. I have been programming since secondary school, where I studied computer science as a part of my GCSEs. I then took my interest in programming further by again studying computer science as one of my A-Levels. More recently I completed a BSc Games Programming course at Goldsmiths University of London, from which I received a first-class honours. On this website I have provided some examples of my work from both university assignments and personal projects alongside links to playable builds for them.

                    <h2>Twin Stick Shooter Game</h2>
                    <p>This was the first game that I developed, with it being for a university assignment that required us to make a twin stick shooter with a unique twist. In this game the player pilots a spaceship and must try and survive against infinite waves of enemies for as long as possible. In order to differentiate this game, I chose to add a mechanic in which the player is able to hack into enemies and take control of them, with their being multiple enemy types with different attack types that the player can possess. This game was developed in the Unity game engine, with all scripting being done in C#.</p>

                    <h2>Percussion Assualt</h2>
                    <p>This game was developed during my second year of university as a group project. I took up a leadership role during development, coming up with the initial idea for it and organizing the other people in my group so that work was divided up fairly. This game is set in a fantasy world based on the 1800s, with the player taking the role of a drummer for a regiment of soldiers. By performing different combinations of notes the player activates various magical abilities to support their allies to help them win. I focussed on implementing the behaviour for the player's allies and enemies as well as the drumming mechanic that the player uses interact with the game. This game was developed in Unity with the code being written in C#. During this project I also got experience using Unity's built-in version control.</p>

                    <h2>Bullet Hell Game</h2>
                    <p>This untitled game was developed as a personal project in between my years at university. It is a level-based bullet hell game in which the player fights gauntlets of regular enemies and then bosses. In the game the player controls two characters, with one attacking and the other moving in order to avoid taking damage. In order to make the enemies I made use of object-oriented programming and inheritance, creating an attack pattern class that was editable in the Unity editor to easily create many different effects. I also made a movement class with a number of children that facilitated different behaviour. I combined these with a script for running the levels, spawning in sequences of enemies in waves based on lists containing objects that store a movement type with coordinates and additional parameters alongside a prefab. I developed this game in Unity and used C#.</p>

                    <h2>Drifting Afloat</h2>
                    <p>I developed this game as a part of the Expressive Game Design module that I took in my final year of university. With my previous games I had tended to move objects using translate and linear interpolations on them, but as this game was a 2D platformer I opted to use Unity's physics system and rigid bodies. As a part of implementing the enemy behaviour to have them patrol and be capable of seeing the player I used raycasts, having to check the details of the collider returned from them. One mechanic that I wanted to add was allowing the player to bounce off of the enemies’ heads, this required getting the position of the bottom of the player and the top of the enemy using their transforms and sprite bound boxes. This game was developed in Unity using C# for scripting.</p>

                    <h2>Dead End Job</h2>
                    <p>This game was my final year project. In this game the player takes the role of the assistant to the Grim Reaper, having to catch lost souls to avoid getting fired. The gameplay consists of two sections, with one being like Pac-Man with the roles reversed and the other being a combination of a bullet hell and Luigi's Mansion. In order to have the enemies attack the player in combat I iterated on my bullet hell pattern classes from my personal project game. I made a number of improvements to the code, adding additional parameters and fixing bugs. In combat the player uses a vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts and dispose of some of their projectiles. Implementing this as a mechanic meant writing vector math operations to simulate objects being pulled in convincingly. To make the game more replayable I added randomised upgrades. Providing these involved making an upgrade class with various optional parameters so that different types could be generated and processed when applied to the player. This game was made in Unity using C# for the scripts.</p>
